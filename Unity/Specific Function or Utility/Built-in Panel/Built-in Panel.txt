How to open built-in panel in Unity Editor?

Case 1:
For Unity Editor:
In Unity Editor, the macro UNITY_EDITOR is defined and 
the UnityEditor namespace is defined.

You can call the method in the class UnityEditor.EditorUtility.
The methods are about built-in panels.

UnityEditor.EditorUtility.OpenFilePanel: 
Open panel and you can select any file, NOT folders.

UnityEditor.EditorUtility.OpenFilePanelWithFilters:
Open panel and you can select the specific file extension which corresponds to the given pararameter.

UnityEditor.EditorUtilityOpenFolderPanel:
Open panel and you can select folders, NOT files.

Case 2:
For Unity Editor, Andriod platform and IOS platform.
You can install the "NativeFilePicker" Plugin
(provided by yasirkula, you can refer the following link (given in reference section [ref])).

You can also use "Simplefilebrowser" Plugin
(provided by yasirkula, you can refer the following link (given in reference section [ref])).

----------------------------------------
P.S.
There are lots of plugins in Unity Asset store.
I just list these two since they are common, free and easy to use.

----------------------------------------
NOTE:
Check the version, including OS version of device for developement and for running and Unity Editor Version 
before using the external plugin to avoid the bugs in package or project or compiler error saying the namespace can NOT be used etc.
