In this article, I will teach you:
How to build an Unity project as packages in Unity.

-----------------------------
The main steps:
Step 1:
In Unity project, select File -> Build Settings.
Step 2:
Add the scene for build (if NOT added).

Step 3:
Check the setting in Edit -> Project Settings-> Player-> <Platform>

Step 4:
Go back to File -> Build Settings.
Select platform for build. 
(If you don't want to build with your current used platform, you must switch platform by clicking "Switch Platform" button.)

Step 5:
Check the settings for build.

Step 6:
Click "Build" or "Build And Run" button.

That's done. You just have to wait a while.

Here, these figures illustrates the steps of building Unity Projects.
